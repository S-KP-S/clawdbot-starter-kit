Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: How many calls does {{company}} miss when you're on a job?

I ask because I just helped an electrician in Texas capture 40% more leads with a simple fix — an AI that answers his phone 24/7.

It costs less than a part-time receptionist ($297/mo vs $55K/year) and it never misses a call. Never calls in sick. Works nights and weekends.

Thought it might be relevant for {{company}}.

If you're curious, you can call our demo line right now and experience it yourself: (216) 260-2703

Or just reply and I'll send over a quick video showing how it works.

Best,
Quinn

P.S. Not a fit? No worries — just reply "pass" and I won't follow up.
