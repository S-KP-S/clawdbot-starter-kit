Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my note about the AI phone system.

Just wanted to share some quick numbers from businesses like {{company}}:

• 62% of calls to small businesses go unanswered
• Average value of a missed call: $150-500
• Time to respond matters: 78% of customers buy from whoever responds first

The fix is pretty simple: an AI that picks up every call, qualifies the lead, and books the appointment.

Would a 15-minute call be worth it to see if this could work for you?

Here's my calendar: https://calendly.com/spencerkstrandholt/tour

Or call our AI right now to hear it in action: (216) 260-2703
