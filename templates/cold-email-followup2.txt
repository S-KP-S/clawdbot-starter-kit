Hey {{first_name}},

Last one from me — I know you're busy running {{company}}.

I'm not sure if you:
a) Saw my emails and aren't interested (totally fine!)
b) Are interested but swamped right now
c) Never got them (spam folders are brutal)

If it's (a), just reply "pass" and I'll stop.

If it's (b) or (c), here's the gist: I help service businesses like yours capture leads 24/7 with an AI phone system. It answers calls, books appointments, and follows up — while you focus on actual work.

Costs $297/mo. 30-day money-back guarantee. Live in 7 days.

Either way, good luck with everything.
