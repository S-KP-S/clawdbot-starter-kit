## Template 1: The Audit Offer (Primary)

**Subject lines (A/B test):**
- "Quick question about {{company_name}}"
- "Noticed something about {{company_name}}"
- "{{first_name}}, 2 hours back in your week?"

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

{{personalization_hook}}

I run an AI automation agency and noticed {{specific_pain_point}}. 

We've helped businesses like yours automate the repetitive stuff — things like {{relevant_examples}} — so the team can focus on what actually moves the needle.

Would you be open to a free 15-min audit call? I'll show you 2-3 quick wins you could implement this month.

No pitch, just value. If it makes sense to work together after, great. If not, you walk away with a game plan.

Worth a quick chat?

## Template 2: The Case Study Hook

**Subject:** How {{similar_company_type}} saved 15 hours/week

Hey {{first_name}},

We just wrapped up a project with a {{similar_business_type}} that was drowning in {{pain_point}}.

After a 2-week implementation, they:
- Cut manual work by 60%
- Automated their entire {{process}}
- Got 15+ hours back every week

{{personalization_hook}}

Thought it might be relevant for {{company_name}}. Want me to share what we did?

## Template 3: The Direct Value Prop

**Subject:** {{first_name}} — quick automation idea

Hey {{first_name}},

Saw {{company_name}} is {{what_they_do}}. 

One thing I've seen work really well for {{business_type}} is automating {{specific_process}}. Usually saves 5-10 hours/week and costs less than a part-time VA.

I'd be happy to sketch out how that would work for you — no charge, no pitch.

Interested?
