# Cold Call Script — SKPS Agency
## AI Employee for Small Business Owners

**Target:** Real estate agents, plumbers, contractors, roofers
**Goal:** Book a 15-minute demo/audit call
**Tone:** Casual, curious, helpful — NOT salesy

---

## 🎯 OPENING (Pattern Interrupt)

> **"Hey [NAME], quick weird question — how many calls did you miss last week?"**

*[Pause. Let them think.]*

**If they answer:**
> "Yeah, that's exactly why I'm calling. I'm Spencer with SKPS Agency — we build AI employees that answer those calls for you. Got 30 seconds?"

**If they say "I don't know":**
> "Most [INDUSTRY] owners I talk to don't either — and that's the scary part. Those are jobs walking out the door. I'm Spencer with SKPS Agency — mind if I ask you one quick question?"

**If they answer the phone with a rushed "Hello?":**
> "Hey, caught you in the middle of something? I'll be quick — 30 seconds, promise."

---

## ✅ QUALIFYING QUESTIONS (Pick 2)

*Keep it conversational. You're diagnosing, not interrogating.*

1. > "When a call comes in and you're on a job site, what happens to it?"

2. > "Do you have someone answering your phones right now, or is it mostly you?"

3. > "What's a new [roofing job / listing / plumbing call] worth to you on average?"

4. > "Ever lost a job because you couldn't get back to someone fast enough?"

**Listen for pain signals:**
- "I try to call back but..."
- "My wife helps sometimes..."
- "I miss a lot when I'm working..."
- "I've been meaning to hire someone..."

---

## 💡 VALUE PROP (30 Seconds or Less)

> "Here's the deal — we've built an AI that answers your phone 24/7, sounds completely human, books appointments right into your calendar, and qualifies leads before you ever talk to them.
>
> It costs less than $300 a month. A receptionist costs $55K a year.
>
> And the AI doesn't call in sick, doesn't need training, and works Christmas."

*[Pause. Let it land.]*

> "Would it help if I showed you exactly how it works for [INDUSTRY] businesses?"

---

## 🚀 THE CLOSE (CTA)

**If interested:**
> "Cool — I do a free 15-minute demo where I'll show you exactly how calls get handled and how appointments show up in your calendar. You can see it in action before you commit to anything.
>
> What's easier — tomorrow morning or later this week?"

**If they want more info first:**
> "Totally fair. How about this — I'll send you a quick 2-minute video that shows how it works. If it makes sense, we'll hop on a call. What's the best email?"

**Backup CTA (if hesitant):**
> "Tell you what — I'll send over one thing. If you hate it, no follow-up, I promise. What's your email?"

---

## 🛡️ OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "I'm busy right now"

> "Totally get it — you're running a business. That's actually why I called. The guys who are too busy to answer their phones are exactly who we help. 
>
> Can I send you a 2-minute video and follow up tomorrow? Or is Thursday better?"

---

### "I'm not interested"

> "No problem — mind if I ask one thing? Is it because you've already got someone handling calls, or you just haven't thought about it yet?"

*[This reopens the conversation 50% of the time]*

**If they have someone:**
> "Got it — are they available nights and weekends too? That's when we see the most leads slip through. Either way, I appreciate your time."

**If they haven't thought about it:**
> "Makes sense. Most owners don't until they realize how much it's costing them. If I send you one quick example, would you look at it?"

---

### "How much does it cost?"

> "Starts at $297 a month. To put that in perspective — a receptionist costs around $55K a year. This does the same job, 24/7, for less than your phone bill.
>
> Want me to show you how the ROI works for a [INDUSTRY] business specifically?"

---

### "I'll think about it"

> "For sure — what specifically do you want to think through? Is it the cost, the tech, or just whether it makes sense for your business?"

*[Diagnose the real objection and address it]*

---

### "Does it actually work?"

> "Fair question. Here's what I can tell you — it's the same technology behind the AI assistants you're already using. Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT. We just trained it specifically for [INDUSTRY].
>
> Best way to know is to see it. I can give you a live demo in 15 minutes. Want to do that?"

---

### "I tried something like this before and it sucked"

> "Yeah, a lot of the old stuff was garbage. Robotic menus, dead ends, customers hanging up. This is different — it's conversational AI. It actually talks like a person, understands context, and books directly into your calendar.
>
> Tell you what — let me call your business phone right now and you can hear it for yourself. Want to do that?"

---

### "Just send me some info"

> "I can do that. What specifically would help you most — a case study, pricing breakdown, or a quick video of how it sounds when it answers?"

*[Gets them to engage and shows you're not just blasting PDFs]*

## 🎭 TONE & DELIVERY NOTES

| Do This | Don't Do This |
|---------|---------------|
| Speak like a peer, not a salesperson | Don't read the script word-for-word |
| Use pauses to let things land | Don't rapid-fire info |
| Mirror their energy level | Don't be overly enthusiastic |
| Ask questions, then shut up | Don't pitch if they haven't confirmed the pain |
| Use their industry language | Don't use jargon like "AI-powered solution" |
| Sound curious, not desperate | Don't push if they're clearly not a fit |

**Mindset:** You're a business owner talking to another business owner about a problem you both understand. You have something that helps. That's it.

---

## 📋 VOICEMAIL SCRIPT

> "Hey [NAME], it's Spencer. Quick question for you — I work with [INDUSTRY] owners and I'm curious how you're handling calls when you're on a job site.
>
> If you're like most guys I talk to, you're losing leads while you're working.
>
> Give me a shout back when you get a chance — [PHONE NUMBER]. Or just text me, whatever's easier. Talk soon."

**Keep it under 20 seconds. Sound like you actually know them.**

---

## 🔄 FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 0 | Call + Voicemail |
| Day 1 | Text: "Hey [NAME], Spencer here. Sent you a voicemail yesterday — got 30 seconds to chat about the missed calls thing?" |
| Day 3 | Email with 2-min demo video |
| Day 5 | Call #2 |
| Day 7 | Text: "Last ping — if answering calls isn't a problem for you, no worries. If it is, I've got something that'll help. LMK." |

## 🎁 BONUS: OWNER SHIP BLUEPRINT UPSELL

*Use this for bigger fish or owners who want done-with-you, not done-for-you.*

> "Actually — some owners don't just want the AI. They want to systematize their whole business so it runs without them. We've got an 8-week program for that called the Owner Ship Blueprint.
>
> It's basically: Audit your business, level up your operations, then automate the boring stuff. By week 8, you're working ON your business instead of IN it.
>
> Is that something you've been thinking about, or do you just want the phone thing handled first?"

---

## ✨ ONE-LINERS TO STEAL

- "What's a missed call worth to you? Because that's what you're paying right now."
- "Your competition is answering calls at 9pm. Are you?"
- "The AI doesn't take lunch breaks, doesn't call in sick, and doesn't ask for a raise."
- "You're paying with lost leads. This just makes the cost visible."
- "If you had an employee that worked 24/7 for $10 a day, would you hire them?"
