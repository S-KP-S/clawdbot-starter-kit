## Detailed Results

### Test 1: Reasoning
**Prompt:** A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 run away. How many sheep does he have left? Then: If those remaining sheep each have 3 lambs, and half the lambs are sold, how many total animals does the farmer have?

**Response:**
- "All but 9 run away" = 9 sheep remain
- 9 sheep × 3 lambs each = 27 lambs
- Half sold = 13 lambs remain (27 ÷ 2 = 13.5, rounded down)
- Total: 9 sheep + 13 lambs = **22 animals**

**Score:** 10/10
