## Late Night Research: AI Meeting Clone

Spencer asked about getting me into Zoom meetings as his avatar clone. Researched options:

**Tavus (winner):** $59/mo starter, all-in-one clone training + real-time avatar + LLM brain. Train from 2-min video, 4-5 hrs processing. CVI outputs WebRTC.

**DIY stack:** Recall.ai + HeyGen + Deepgram + ElevenLabs + Claude ≈ $0.29/min but 40-80 hrs dev time.

**Shelved for later** — added full details to MEMORY.md under "Shelved / Future Projects".
