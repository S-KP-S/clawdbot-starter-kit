## Ideas Backlog Addition
- **Wholesale Real Estate Deals** - Restart with Terrasol, get back in the game

## CRITICAL: Hyperliquid Deadline
- **Target:** $1,000 by Jan 31st
- **Current:** ~$580
- **Gap:** ~$420 in 2 days
- **Stakes:** Clawdbot subscription renewal depends on this
- **Priority:** Fix trend filter to prevent HYPE-style losses

## HIP-3 Perp DEX Integration ✅
Applied HIP-3 support to both Hyperliquid traders:

**autonomous_trader.py:**
- Added direct API calls for HIP-3 assets (SDK doesn't support `provider:ASSET` format)
- Expanded asset coverage to 50+ HIP-3 perps:
  - **xyz:** Commodities (GOLD, SILVER, OIL), equities (TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, etc.), FX
  - **km (Kinetiq):** US indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 2000), bonds
  - **flx (Felix):** Metals focus
  - **vntl (Ventuals):** Pre-IPO exposure - SpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic 🔥
- `get_candles()` now auto-detects HIP-3 vs regular assets

**copy_trader.py:**
- `get_current_price()` now handles HIP-3 assets via direct API
- Can track and copy positions in any HIP-3 perp

**Helper module:** `hip3_assets.py` with all providers/assets and utility functions

Committed: `feat: HIP-3 perp DEX support for autonomous + copy trader`
