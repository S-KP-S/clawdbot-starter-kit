## Session summary
- First real working session with Spencer
- Ran project scan across C: drive, found 3 main code projects
- Spawned 3 sub-agents to analyze each project for innovation
- Winner: **earth-journey-portfolio** (6.5/10 innovation score)
- Installed `gog` CLI to %APPDATA%\npm
- Enabled voice-call plugin in gateway config
- Switched model to Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5
- Spencer asked about email setup (not yet configured)

## To revisit
- Email setup for Clawdbot (Gmail vs Workspace, draft-for-approval flow)
- USER.md and IDENTITY.md still need to be filled in

## Learned
- PowerShell commands via Bash tool have escaping issues; write to .ps1 file and run with `-File` instead
- Use `cmd /c` for simple Windows commands to avoid parsing problems
