## Dashboard v2 Project Notes (from client voice note)

Client wants to prioritize Dashboard v2 over AI sales call grader.

### New Point System
- Active agents: 2 points
- Calls: 1 point
- Properties: 0 points (removed)
- Offers: 3 points
- Signed contracts: 5 points
- Could 10x all values for visual impact on leaderboard
- Text tracking removed (not useful to them)

### Metrics to Track
- Calls
- Talk time
- Offers
- Properties collected
- Agents activated
- Offers made
- Contracts signed

### Goal
- Set daily point targets (e.g., 100 points/day)
- Use for performance management

### Roadmap
1. Dashboard v2 (current focus, $500)
2. AI-powered sales call grader / sales manager
3. New hire wholesaling course (spring, after 6-10 closings)
4. Training platform (School or Kajabi, ~$150/mo)
5. HR person to manage hiring/firing based on AI metrics

### Next Steps
- Monday morning call to discuss dashboard iteration
- $500 payment for current work, then start v2
