# The Compound Playbook

*Building a landmaxxing operation for nutrition, revenue, and freedom*

---

## Vision

Own a compound that achieves three objectives:
1. **Nutrition abundance** — Automated farm producing top-tier food
2. **Maximum $/acre** — Multiple revenue streams from the land
3. **Self-sufficiency** — Long-term freedom and resilience

---

## Revenue Streams (Landmaxxing)

### 1. Short-Term Rentals (STR)
**Revenue potential:** $100-500/night per unit

**Options:**
- **Glamping** — Yurts, A-frames, treehouses
- **Tiny homes** — Low construction cost, high appeal
- **Farm stays** — Agritourism is growing 20%+ annually
- **Airbnb arbitrage** — Start renting before building

**Key metrics:**
- Occupancy rate target: 60-70%
- ADR (average daily rate) varies by market
- STR income can cover land mortgage

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Research STR regulations in target areas
- [ ] Analyze Airbnb data for rural properties
- [ ] Identify high-performing agritourism listings

---

### 2. Event Venue
**Revenue potential:** $2,000-15,000+ per event

**Event types:**
- Weddings (highest margin)
- Corporate retreats
- Workshops/classes
- Private dinners
- Photography sessions

**Infrastructure needed:**
- Scenic outdoor area
- Indoor backup space
- Parking (or shuttle)
- Restrooms
- Power/lighting

**Key metrics:**
- 30-50 events/year is realistic
- Wedding venues can gross $100K-500K/year
- Lower maintenance than STR (fewer turnovers)

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Research wedding venue regulations
- [ ] Identify venue-friendly properties
- [ ] Cost out basic venue infrastructure

---

### 3. Farm-to-Table / CSA
**Revenue potential:** $200-800/member/season

**Models:**
- **CSA (Community Supported Agriculture)** — Upfront payment, weekly boxes
- **Farm stand** — On-site sales
- **Restaurant supply** — Contract with local restaurants
- **Farmers markets** — Direct to consumer

**Crops to consider:**
- High-value: Microgreens, mushrooms, honey, eggs
- Market gardens: Tomatoes, peppers, greens
- Perennials: Fruit trees, berries

**Key metrics:**
- 1 acre can generate $20-50K+ with intensive methods
- CSA provides predictable cash flow
- Combine with STR for "farm stay" premium

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Research no-till / regenerative methods
- [ ] Identify high-value, low-maintenance crops
- [ ] Explore automation options (irrigation, etc.)

---

### 4. Additional Revenue Streams

**Passive/Semi-passive:**
- Solar lease / net metering
- Timber (if forested)
- Hunting leases
- Storage (RV/boat)
- Cell tower lease

**Active:**
- Workshops / classes (farming, cooking, crafts)
- Retreat hosting
- Photography location rental

## Land Hacking Strategies

### 1. House Hack + Land
Buy property with livable structure, rent out parts while building.

### 2. Raw Land + Mobile Structure
- Buy cheap raw land
- Place yurt/RV/tiny home
- Build STR income while developing

### 3. Conservation Easements
- Reduce property taxes
- Potential tax deduction
- Protect land long-term

### 4. USDA Programs
- Beginning Farmer Loans (low interest)
- Conservation programs (cost-share)
- Rural development grants

### 5. Seller Financing
- Lower barrier to entry
- Negotiate terms directly
- Good for rural properties

---

## Automation Opportunities

**Farm automation:**
- Automated irrigation (drip + timers)
- Soil sensors + monitoring
- Automatic feeders (chickens)
- Robotics (eventually — Farmbot, etc.)

**Property automation:**
- Smart locks for STR
- Automated check-in/out
- Security cameras
- Remote monitoring

**Business automation:**
- Booking management
- Guest communication
- Payment processing
- Review requests
